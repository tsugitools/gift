::AS_Q1::
In Python, what is a variable really?
{
=Correct Answer~A container holding a value
~A fixed memory location
~A data structure
}

::AS_Q2::
What happens when you execute x = 42?
{
=Correct Answer~The value 42 is copied into x
~Memory inside x is modified
~x becomes immutable
}

::AS_Q3::
After x = 42 and y = x, which is true?
{
=Correct Answer~y gets a copy of x
~x is deleted
~A new integer object is created
}

::AS_Q4::
Which function helps determine whether two names refer to the same object?
{
=Correct Answer~type()
~dir()
~len()
}

::AS_Q5::
Why is the “variable as a box” metaphor misleading?
{
=Correct Answer~Variables cannot change
~Objects cannot be shared
~Memory is hidden
}

::AS_Q6::
Which of the following is an immutable type?
{
=Correct Answer~List
~Dictionary
~Set
}

::AS_Q7::
Why does x = x + 1 create a new integer object?
{
=Correct Answer~x is read-only
~Python copies eagerly
~Garbage collection runs
}

::AS_Q8::
What happens when you assign y = x where x is a list?
{
=Correct Answer~The list is copied
~The list becomes immutable
~A new list is created
}

::AS_Q9::
Why can modifying x also change y in this case?
{
=Correct Answer~Lists are global
~Assignment copies values
~Python passes lists by value
}

::AS_Q10::
Which creates a shallow copy of a list?
{
=Correct Answer~y =Correct Answer~y =Correct Answer~y =Correct Answer}

::AS_Q11::
What does assignment NEVER do in Python?
{
=Correct Answer~Bind a name
~Rebind a name
~Change what a name refers to
}

::AS_Q12::
Why is shared mutable state dangerous?
{
=Correct Answer~It slows execution
~It breaks templates
~It confuses the garbage collector
}

::AS_Q13::
How does this relate to Django views?
{
=Correct Answer~Views copy objects per request
~Templates isolate state
~Sessions fix assignment
}

::AS_Q14::
Why are instance attributes safer than class attributes?
{
=Correct Answer~They are immutable
~They are faster
~They persist across requests
}

::AS_Q15::
Which assignment creates a new binding?
{
=Correct Answer~x.append(1)
~x.sort()
~x.pop()
}

::AS_Q16::
Which operation mutates an existing object?
{
=Correct Answer~x =Correct Answer~x =Correct Answer~x =Correct Answer}

::AS_Q17::
Why does Django avoid storing request-specific data on the class?
{
=Correct Answer~Classes cannot store data
~Templates reset state
~Sessions overwrite values
}

::AS_Q18::
Which Python concept explains why per-request state works?
{
=Correct Answer~Variables are cleared automatically
~Garbage collection runs immediately
~Templates isolate data
}

::AS_Q19::
How does understanding assignment help debugging?
{
=Correct Answer~It explains routing errors
~It improves CSS layout
~It fixes authentication
}

::AS_Q20::
Which statement best summarizes Python assignment?
{
=Correct Answer~Assignment copies values into variables
~Assignment allocates memory per variable
~Assignment isolates state automatically
}
